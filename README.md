# Airbnb NYC Data Analysis

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes Airbnb listings in New York City to uncover patterns in pricing, availability, and customer reviews. Using a dataset of thousands of listings, the study applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to reveal market dynamics and identify key factors influencing rental behavior in one of the world's busiest urban lodging markets.

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  


## Dataset  
The dataset contains Airbnb rental listings in NYC, including details such as price, location, room type, availability, number of reviews, and host information. It is sourced from Inside Airbnb and contains tens of thousands of listings from recent years.

## Key Features and Analysis  
- Data cleaning to handle missing or inconsistent values  
- Exploratory analysis of listing price distribution, neighborhood trends, and room types  
- Visualization of geographic distribution and seasonal availability  
- Identification of price determinants using feature analysis and machine learning models  
- Insights into customer satisfaction through review count and ratings trends  

## How to Use  
1. Load and preprocess the dataset in Python using Pandas.  
2. Perform EDA to explore data attributes and relationships.  
3. Use visualization libraries to create charts that highlight key insights.  
4. Optionally, apply machine learning models to predict pricing and analyze feature importance.  

## Conclusion  
This analysis provides a deeper understanding of the New York City short-term rental market via Airbnb listings. The findings help hosts optimize pricing and availability, assist guests in making informed choices, and support policymakers and researchers in evaluating the impact of short-term rentals on urban housing dynamics.
